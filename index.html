    <header>Day 1 / Challenge 1 - BMI Calculator</header>
    <article>
      <p>Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:<br>
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).</p>

      <h3>Your tasks:</h3>
<p>1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables<br>
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)<br>
3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

      <h3>Test data:</h3>
ยง Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
m tall. <br>
ยง Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
m tall.</p>
      
 <h3>My Solution</h3>
            <code>let heightMark = 1.68;
let weightMark = 78;

let heightJohn = 1.95;
let weightJohn = 92;

heightMark = 1.88;
weightMark = 95;

heightJohn = 1.76;
weightJohn = 85;

const markBMI = weightMark / (heightMark ** 2);
const johnBMI = weightJohn / (heightJohn ** 2);

console.log("Marks BMI is " + markBMI, "while Johns BMI is " + johnBMI);

const markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI;
console.log(markHigherBMI);</code>
      
        <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
        
<p>I have had some experience creating a BMI calculator
